title: Poll - Did the moon launch video show for you?
---
## I have very little data on this so curious if I should redo that part (because the video is awesome) 

This assumes that you went to the moon when you played the game.

### If you don't have twitter, please vote via [this strawpoll](http://www.strawpoll.me/16219395){:target="_blank"}.

Also if you had any other issues that bare mentioning, you can easily [tweet me](https://twitter.com/rkn_dev){:target="_blank"} or use the disqus comment section below, thanks! I recently learned that low/mid-end hardware gets high CPU and RAM usage, so I need to do some further optimizations and add an option to lower the FPS from 60. So you don't need to mention that! :D

#### For those wondering, the deadline of the update release (~13-19th of August) is still looking good!

I do have to mention that I estimate a 50/50 chance that the release will be delayed to after the weekend (so like Monday the 22nd), but still aiming to hit the 13-19th window, simply because it's a good motivator.

_PS: I  recommend you stop buying those super-expensive upgrades, if you intend to do the mission (you probably want to). Upgrades don't contribute to mission rewards and they are getting big buffs in the update._
