Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes:

jekyll serve

View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.

Everything in _site will be removed every time jekyll serve is used, so don't store shit there.
Add files to not-be-copied in _config.yml

Linking images:

* A bulletted list

2. ordered
3. list

Inline markup styles:

- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()`

> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote

Syntax highlighting can be used with triple backticks, like so:

```javascript
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  

Finally, horizontal lines
